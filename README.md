# Single Secret Design (SSD) — Secure, Scalable Secret Management for Departments

## Overview:
The Single Secret Design (SSD) is a cost-effective and flexible strategy for managing secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Instead of creating individual secrets for every credential or config item, SSD consolidates all secrets for a single department (e.g., CloudOps, Networking, Infra) into one structured JSON secret, significantly reducing monthly costs and improving manageability.

## Structure:
Each secret entry is a key-value pair, where:
- The key is a unique identifier for a system, tool, or integration (e.g., argocd-staging, terraform-provisioner)
- The value is a flexible object (dictionary) with user-defined attributes like user, password, url, token, etc.

```json
{
  "argocd-staging": {
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "s3cret",
    "url": "https://argocd.staging.company.com"
  },
  "terraform-provisioner": {
    "user": "terraform",
    "password": "p@ssw0rd"
  },
  "site-xyz": {
    "url": "https://xyz.company.com",
    "user": "john",
    "password": "abc123"
  }
}
```

## Benefits:
- Security: Centralized, encrypted storage with IAM-based access control.
- Cost efficiency: Only one secret per department, reducing the $0.40/secret/month pricing overhead.
- Flexibility: No rigid schema—each secret can contain freely defined fields.
- Simplicity: Easy to read, update, and integrate with applications using standard AWS SDKs or CLI.
- Scalable: Can support dozens or even hundreds of secrets per department, up to 64 KB.

## Use Cases:
- CloudOps teams managing tools like ArgoCD, Terraform, CI/CD tokens
- Infra teams storing VPN, database, and software license credentials
- Networking teams handling router/switch admin logins, webhook keys, etc.
